#Big O

It shows how an algorithm scales.

**O(n2): known as Quadratic complexity**

1 item: 1 second
10 items: 100 seconds
100 items: 10000 seconds
Notice that the number of items increases by a factor of 10, but the time increases by a factor of 102. Basically, n=10 and so O(n2) gives us the scaling factor n2 which is 102.

**O(n): known as Linear complexity**

1 item: 1 second
10 items: 10 seconds
100 items: 100 seconds
This time the number of items increases by a factor of 10, and so does the time. n=10 and so O(n)'s scaling factor is 10.

**O(1): known as Constant complexity**

1 item: 1 second
10 items: 1 second
100 items: 1 second
The number of items is still increasing by a factor of 10, but the scaling factor of O(1) is always 1.

**O(log n): known as Logarithmic complexity**

1 item: 1 second
10 items: 2 seconds
100 items: 3 seconds
1000 items: 4 seconds
10000 items: 5 seconds
The number of computations is only increased by a log of the input value. So in this case, assuming each computation takes 1 second, the log of the input n is the time required, hence log n.

That's the gist of it. They reduce the maths down so it might not be exactly n2 or whatever they say it is, but that'll be the dominating factor in the scaling.
